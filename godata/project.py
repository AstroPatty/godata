    This is at thin wrapper class for the associated Project struct in the rust library.
    In general, this class just calls the underlying rust methods. However, it does have
    to provide additional behavior in particular cases. For example, storing a python
    object requires a function that knows how to write the given object to a file, which
    will most likely be in python.

    Note that in most cases error handling is actually done by the rust library, so in
    almost all cases expect that an exception encountered while using this class is
    coming from there.

    This class also provides docstrings for the underlying methods, such that all
    user-facing documentation can be done with sphinx.
